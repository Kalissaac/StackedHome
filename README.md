# StackedHome

A modern stacked homescreen for XenHTML. Requires XenInfo for weather information and [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for fonts. This was created as a fun project and will probably never be updated.

**Disclaimer:** Sizes optimized for iPhone 7. Other screen sizes may need to adjust text to desirable font size.

## Installation:
1. Download repository files
2. Copy files into `/var/mobile/Library/SBHTML/`
3. Apply in XenHTML
4. ???
5. Profit.
